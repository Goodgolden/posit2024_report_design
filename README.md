# Report Design in R: Small Tweaks that Make a Big Difference

If you've ever tried to improve how your Quarto-based reports look, you probably felt overwhelmed. I'm a data person, you may have thought, not a designer. It's easy to drown in a sea of design advice, but we at R for the Rest of Us have found that a few small tweaks can make a big difference. In this talk, we will discuss ways that we have learned to make high-quality reports in R. These include ways you can consistently use brand fonts and colors in your report text and in your plots. All of these tweaks are small on their own, but, when combined, have the potential to make a big difference in the quality of your report design.
