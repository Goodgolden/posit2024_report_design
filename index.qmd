# Does Design Matter?

- Talk about how some devs don't think it matters at all

## Aesthetic Usability Effect {.center}

. . .

Users see aesthetically pleasing designs as more intuitive

## Good Design Builds Trust

Putting effort into your charts shows respect for your audience

## Good Design Builds Trust

Putting effort into your charts shows respect for your audience, **which means that they in turn are going to respect you and your findings**.


## R Users Are Not Designers

But design is a skill that can be taught and R users already have many of the skills needed to do good design

## Colors

::: {.notes}
In this section, just show report, don't do any code
:::

### Use brand colors

- Show how to use color picker

### Use same colors in plots and tables and in text

### Make palette with `monochromeR` package

### Use colors consistently (e.g. red = town, pink = county, gray = state; https://show.rfor.us/XB40stB9)

- Make `scale_color_psc()` starting with `scale_color_manual()`

https://show.rfor.us/ycg8TXjG

## Text

### Choose one font or maybe two fonts and stick with them

### My favorite fonts

**Serif**

- Inter
- Roboto
- Public Sans
- Geist Sans
- Overpass
- Instrument Sans
- Inclusive Sans

**Sans Serif**

- Instrument Serif

**Monospace**

- Geist Mono
- IBM Plex Mono
- Ubuntu Mono
- Overpass Mono
- Roboto Mono

- Use fonts that have whole families

### Use fonts in plots and tables

#### Maybe use monospaced font in tables

## Plots

- Make functions to keep them consistent

- Use fonts in theme

- Use `set_geom_defaults()` to make all `geom_text()` elements use same font

- Show dot plot

- Show age of units and units by age and fuel type

## Additional Design Elements

- Big numbers

- TODO: figure out whether to do this in ggplot or use HTML/CSS/typst or remove this?

## Tables

- Make table function

- Show it without colors, then with colors

- Show it without brand font, then with brand font

## {background-image="assets/who-runs-the-world.gif" .inverse}

## PDFs (sorry) {background-image="assets/who-runs-the-world.gif" .inverse}

## `typst`

### Color

- Apply brand colors to template for sections

### Fonts

- Apply brand fonts to template

### Alignment

- Use patchwork

- Use Quarto columns

- Use typst columns
