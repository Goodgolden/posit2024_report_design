# Good Design is Just a Few Small Tweaks {background-image="assets/tweaks2.jpg" .inverse}

## Plots

- Make functions to keep them consistent

## Additional Design Elements

- e.g. big numbers in Sustain East Africa template

## Colors

- Use brand colors

- Use same colors in plots and tables and in text

- Use colors consistently (e.g. red = town, pink = county, gray = state; https://show.rfor.us/XB40stB9)

- Use colors to define sections (PSC)

## Text

- Choose one font or maybe two fonts and stick with them

- Use fonts in plots and text

- Create visual hierarchy with headings
